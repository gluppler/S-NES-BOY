# NES Programming Knowledge Base

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A comprehensive, hardware-accurate guide to NES programming, from fundamentals to advanced patterns. This knowledge base provides everything you need to understand and program for the Nintendo Entertainment System, with a focus on real hardware accuracy and practical implementation.

## Overview

This project is a complete reference for NES programming, covering:

- **Fundamentals**: Core concepts and hardware understanding
- **Advanced Fundamentals**: Timing, constraints, and hardware-specific details
- **Core Concepts**: System interactions and architectural patterns
- **Cheatsheets**: Quick reference tables for active coding
- **Applied Patterns**: Reusable solutions for common problems
- **Tooling & Debugging**: Development tools and techniques
- **Real Hardware**: Considerations for actual NES hardware

## Quick Start

1. **Start with Fundamentals**: Read sections 1.1–1.5 to establish correct mental models
2. **Move to Advanced Fundamentals**: Read sections 2.1–2.5 to understand timing and constraints
3. **Learn Core Concepts**: Read sections 3.1–3.5 to understand system interactions
4. **Use Cheatsheets**: Keep sections 4.1–4.5 open while coding
5. **Apply Patterns**: Reference sections 5.1–5.5 when implementing features
6. **Set Up Tooling**: Follow section 6.1 to set up your development environment
7. **Test on Hardware**: Read section 7 before finalizing your game

## Documentation

The complete documentation is located in the [`docs/`](docs/) directory. Start with [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) for a complete overview.

## Philosophy

This knowledge base follows these principles:

- **Hardware-first**: No abstractions until justified
- **Assembly-aware**: C is treated as a convenience layer, not the truth
- **Deterministic**: Cycle counts, registers, memory maps matter
- **Cross-linked**: Concepts reference each other, not isolated chapters
- **Cheatsheet-driven**: Fast recall is a first-class feature

## Requirements

- Basic programming knowledge
- Understanding of assembly language (helpful but not required)
- Interest in retro game development and hardware programming

## Template

A minimal NES program template is available in the [`template/`](template/) directory:

```bash
cd template
make          # Build template.nes
make run      # Run in FCEUX
make clean    # Clean build files
```

See [`template/README.md`](template/README.md) for complete documentation.

**Note**: This is a documentation project focused on NES programming. For actual NES game development, you'll also need:
- An assembler (ca65, asm6f, etc.)
- An emulator (Mesen2, FCEUX, etc.)
- A flashcart (for testing on real hardware)
