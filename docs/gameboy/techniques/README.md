- **Reusable solutions to common problems**: Patterns that can be adapted for different projects
- **System-adaptive approaches**: Techniques that work within Game Boy limitations
- **Proven implementation strategies**: Methods verified to work correctly

## Current Status

This directory is currently being populated with applied pattern documentation organized by subsystem.
