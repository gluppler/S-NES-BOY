# NES Gold Standard Examples

This directory contains **hardware-accurate reference implementations** demonstrating correct NES programming patterns. These examples serve as authoritative references for hardware-accurate NES development.

## Important Note

**"Gold Standard" in this context means hardware-accurate reference implementations**, not Nintendo's Seal of Quality (which was a licensing/quality assurance program for commercial games). These examples are technical references demonstrating correct hardware usage, not commercial quality certifications.

## Purpose

Examples placed here must be:
- **Verified to work on real hardware**: Tested on actual NES hardware or verified emulators (Mesen2, FCEUX)
- **Demonstrating correct hardware behavior**: Show proper use of NES hardware features with hardware-accurate timing
- **Clearly documented with hardware rationale**: Explain why the implementation is correct, referencing authoritative sources
- **Serving as reference implementations**: Can be used as templates for similar functionality
- **Traceable to authoritative sources**: Based on NesDev Wiki, official documentation, or verified hardware behavior

## Current Status

This directory is currently empty. Gold-standard examples will be added as verified, hardware-accurate implementations become available.

Examples will only be added if they:
1. Are from official Nintendo documentation or widely recognized authoritative sources
2. Have been verified to work correctly on real NES hardware by multiple independent sources
3. Are traceable to official documentation or verified hardware behavior
4. Include complete documentation with authoritative source citations

**Important**: Only examples from official Nintendo documentation, verified test ROMs, or widely recognized authoritative sources that have been independently verified on real hardware will be included. Third-party GitHub repositories or unverified examples will not be added.
