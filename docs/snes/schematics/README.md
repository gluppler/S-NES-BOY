# SNES Schematics

This directory is reserved for verified hardware schematics and diagrams related to SNES hardware.

## Purpose

Schematics placed here must be:
- **Verified against official documentation or hardware analysis**: Accurate and traceable to authoritative sources
- **Clearly labeled with source attribution**: Include references to original sources
- **Relevant to SNES hardware architecture or behavior**: Directly applicable to SNES development

## Current Status

This directory is currently empty. Schematics will be added as verified sources become available.
