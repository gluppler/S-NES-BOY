# NES Tests Directory

This directory contains test files for the NES development template.

## Purpose

Test files placed here should:
- **Verify hardware behavior**: Test CPU instructions, PPU rendering, and timing
- **Validate correctness**: Ensure code works correctly on real hardware
- **Document expected behavior**: Show what correct hardware behavior looks like

## Subdirectories

- `cpu_tests/` – CPU instruction and timing tests
- `ppu_tests/` – PPU rendering and timing tests
- `timing_tests/` – Frame timing and synchronization tests

## Current Status

This directory is currently empty. Test files will be added as needed for validation and debugging.
